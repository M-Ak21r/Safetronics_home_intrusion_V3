# Authorized Personnel Directory

Place face images of authorized personnel in this directory.

## Supported Formats
- `.jpg` / `.jpeg`
- `.png`
- `.bmp`

## Guidelines
1. Use clear, front-facing photos
2. Good lighting is important
3. One face per image works best
4. Name files descriptively (e.g., `john_smith.jpg`)

## Example Structure
```
authorized_personnel/
├── employee_001.jpg
├── employee_002.png
└── security_guard.jpg
```

The system will automatically load all valid face images from this directory
and add them to the "Safe List" during initialization.
